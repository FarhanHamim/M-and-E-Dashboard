# Data Isolation Implementation

## 🔒 **Complete Data Isolation Implemented**

The M&E Dashboard now enforces strict data isolation, ensuring that users can only view and edit data they have created themselves.

## 🎯 **Key Changes Made**

### **1. Database Schema Updates**
- Added `created_by` field to `Cluster`, `Project`, and `Indicator` models
- All new records automatically track who created them
- Existing data assigned to `undp_user` for backward compatibility

### **2. User Views Updated**
- **Cluster Management**: Users only see clusters they created
- **Project Management**: Users only see projects they created  
- **Indicator Management**: Users only see indicators they created
- **Data Entry**: Users can only submit data for their own projects

### **3. Permission System Enhanced**
- Updated `project_access_required` decorator to check ownership
- Updated `indicator_access_required` decorator to check ownership
- All CRUD operations now verify user ownership

### **4. Template Updates**
- Dashboard shows "My Clusters", "My Projects", "My Indicators"
- Clear messaging that users see only their own data
- Updated empty state messages to reflect ownership

## 🚫 **What Users CANNOT Do**

### **Project Users:**
- ❌ View other users' clusters, projects, or indicators
- ❌ Edit data created by other users
- ❌ Delete data created by other users
- ❌ Submit data for projects they don't own
- ❌ Access URLs directly to view other users' data

### **Admin Users:**
- ✅ Can view ALL data for review and reporting
- ✅ Cannot create/edit/delete clusters, projects, or indicators
- ✅ Can only review submitted data and generate reports

## 🧪 **Test Users Available**

### **Test User 1: `undp_user`**
- **Password:** `password123`
- **Role:** Project User
- **Data:** 10 clusters, 4 projects, 8 indicators (all UNDP sample data)

### **Test User 2: `test_user`**
- **Password:** `password123`  
- **Role:** Project User
- **Data:** 1 cluster, 1 project, 1 indicator (test data)

## 🔍 **How to Test Data Isolation**

1. **Login as `undp_user`**
   - See 10 clusters, 4 projects, 8 indicators
   - Can edit/delete all of them (they own them)

2. **Login as `test_user`**
   - See 1 cluster, 1 project, 1 indicator
   - Cannot see `undp_user`'s data
   - Cannot edit `undp_user`'s data

3. **Login as admin**
   - See ALL data from both users
   - Cannot create/edit/delete anything
   - Can only review and generate reports

## 🛡️ **Security Features**

### **URL Protection**
- Direct URL access blocked for unauthorized data
- 404 errors for non-existent or unauthorized records
- Proper error messages for access violations

### **Form Validation**
- All forms verify user ownership before saving
- Server-side validation prevents unauthorized updates
- Database constraints ensure data integrity

### **Template Security**
- Templates only display user's own data
- No cross-user data leakage in lists or details
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

## 📊 **Data Flow**

```
User Creates Data → created_by field set → Only user can see/edit
Admin Reviews Data → Can see all data → Read-only access
Other Users → Cannot see data → Access denied
```

## ✅ **Verification Steps**

1. **Create new user** and verify they see empty dashboard
2. **Create data** and verify only creator can see it
3. **Try direct URL access** to other users' data (should fail)
4. **Test admin access** to verify they can see all data
5. **Test data submission** to verify ownership requirements

## 🎉 **Result**

The system now provides complete data isolation where:
- **Users own their data** and can only access what they create
- **Admins can review everything** but cannot modify structure
- **No data leakage** between users
- **Secure access control** at all levels

This ensures proper data privacy and prevents users from accidentally or intentionally accessing other users' work!
